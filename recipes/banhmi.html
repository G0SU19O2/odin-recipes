      <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 carrot, sliced into sticks</li>
      <li>1 daikon (white) radish, sliced into sticks</li>
      <li>1 cup rice vinegar</li>
      <li>½ cup fresh lime juice</li>
      <li>½ cup cold water</li>
      <li>½ cup chilled lime juice</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon nuoc mam (Vietnamese fish sauce)</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon toasted sesame oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
      <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>⅓ cup cold water</li>
      <li>1 jalapeno pepper, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>8 sprigs fresh cilantro with stems</li>
      <li>1 medium cucumber, sliced into thin strips</li>
      <li>2 sprigs fresh Thai basil</li>
      <li>2 (7 inch) French bread baguettes, split lengthwise</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place the mushrooms
        on a baking sheet. Drizzle with a little olive oil and season with salt
        and pepper. Roast in the preheated oven for about 25 minutes. Cool
        slightly, then slice into strips.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the mushrooms are roasting, bring a saucepan of water to a boil.
        Plunge the carrot and radish sticks into the boiling water and after a
        few seconds, remove them and plunge them into a bowl of ice water to
        stop the cooking.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl, stir together the rice vinegar, 1/2 cup of lime
        juice and 1/2 cup cold water. Transfer the carrot and radish to the
        vinegar and lime marinade and let them soak for at least 15 minutes,
        longer if it's convenient.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, stir together the remaining lime juice, soy sauce, fish
        sauce, sesame oil, canola oil, 1/3 cup sugar and 1/3 cup water. This is
        the sandwich sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        To assemble sandwiches, sprinkle a little of the sandwich sauce onto
        each half of the French loaves. Place the roasted mushrooms onto the
        bottom half of each roll and sprinkle with a little more sauce. Top with
        a few slices of jalapeno, a few sticks of carrot and radish (minus the
        marinade), cucumber, basil and cilantro. Close with the tops of the
        bread and serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
